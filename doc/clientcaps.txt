Use cases for client capabilities
=================================

.. contents::

Issues
------

* We need a way for special-purpose apps to be a low priority handler for
  more general channels - a Tubes-capable AbiWord probably shouldn't handle
  Text or VoIP channels unless no general-purpose UI is available (and
  perhaps not even then)

Empathy
-------

... or other general-purpose IM client. (This is a hypothetical future
version of Empathy - it doesn't do everything listed here yet)

* ChannelType = Text, TargetHandleType = CONTACT
* ChannelType = StreamedMedia, TargetHandleType = NONE
* ChannelType = FileTransfer, TargetHandleType = CONTACT

AbiWord
-------

... or other collaborative app. (Again, this is a hypothetical future
version - it doesn't do everything listed here yet, and perhaps never will)

* ChannelType = DBusTube, Service = com.abisource.AbiCollab (or something)
* ChannelType = Text, TargetHandleType = CONTACT, low priority
* ChannelType = StreamedMedia, TargetHandleType = NONE, low priority
* ChannelType = FileTransfer, TargetHandleType = CONTACT, low priority
* ChannelType = FileTransfer, ContentType = 'text/abiword' ?

OpenArena
---------

Hypothetically...

* ChannelType = PacketTube, service = _openarena._udp (or something)
