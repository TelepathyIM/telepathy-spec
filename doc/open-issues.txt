Open issues in this branch
==========================

Major
-----

File transfers might need more than one non-passive handler - anyone can
stop the file transfer (although only one component can know where the
bytes are coming from/going to)

Contact lists and groups can easily have multiple non-passive handlers -
is it OK to use observers for this?

req1_: how do we tell the CM about our new vs existing requirements?

req3_: can we safely disallow creating new channels with the wrong bundle ID?

req26b_: mid-air collision where local and remote try to reopen the same
conversation

req5_: is this proposed implementation OK?

req7_: how do chatroom threads work?

dis2_: what happens when a Text channel-handler crashes?

.. _dis2: dispatch.html#dis2

dis5d_: how do we know a suppress-handler request should go to a particular
client?

.. _dis5d: dispatch.html#dis5d

req22_, dis20_: increased importance of getting FTs handled by
collaborative app if they are part of the collab protocol

.. _dis20: dispatch.html#dis20
.. _req22: request.html#req22

dis26_: how do approvers interact with non-incoming channels? Particularly,
unknown directionality => pain

.. _dis26: dispatch.html#dis26

req36_: cancelling an outgoing call (just needs writing)

.. _req36: request.html#req36

Minor/corner-case
-----------------

req29_, req30_: two contacts call each other simultaneously

dis12_: how do we know when all groups have arrived?

.. _dis12: dispatch.html#dis12

dis14_: forcibly joining chatrooms, psychic mode

.. _dis14: dispatch.html#dis14
