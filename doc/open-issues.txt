Open issues in this branch
==========================

Major
-----

File transfers might need more than one non-passive handler - anyone can
stop the file transfer (although only one component can know where the
bytes are coming from/going to)

Contact lists and groups can easily have multiple non-passive handlers -
is it OK to use observers for this?

dis2_: what happens when a Text channel-handler crashes?

.. _dis2: dispatch.html#dis2

req22_, dis20_: increased importance of getting FTs handled by
collaborative app if they are part of the collab protocol

.. _dis20: dispatch.html#dis20
.. _req22: request.html#req22

req36_: cancelling an outgoing call (needs writing)

.. _req36: request.html#req36

Minor/corner-case
-----------------

Text channels could conceivably have multiple sources of messages, and even
multiple sinks of messages, but there are coordination problems:

* no handler should ack messages until all handlers have bound to signals

* exactly one handler should ack each message

dis12_: how do we know when all groups have arrived?

.. _dis12: dispatch.html#dis12

dis14_: forcibly joining chatrooms, psychic mode

.. _dis14: dispatch.html#dis14
