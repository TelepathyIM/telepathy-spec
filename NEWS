telepathy-spec 0.23.1 (UNRELEASED)
==================================

telepathy-spec 0.23.1 (2011-05-09)
==================================

This first release in the 0.23 development branch contains all the fixes and
additions from 0.22.3.

Enhancements:

• Channel.Interface.SMS.GetSMSLength() to allow SMS message chunking to be
  shown to the user. (Danni)

• ChannelDispatcher.DelegateChannels() to move channels between handlers.
  (fdo #25293, Guillaume)

• ChannelDispatcher.PresentChannel(): convenient API to re-ensure an existing
  channel. (fdo #25293, Guillaume)


telepathy-spec 0.22.3 (2011-05-09)
==================================

Fixes:

• Correct DBus_Property-parameter boilerplate. (fdo #37005, Will)

telepathy-spec 0.22.2 (2011-04-20)
==================================

The “every cell stayed the same” release.

Once again, this release in the stable series includes some minor API
additions.

Enhancements:

• Channel.Interface.SMS now includes some sample contact capabilities.
  (Danni)

• Connection.Interface.Balance now has a ManageCreditURI property.
  (fd.o#36254, Danni)

• Connection.Interface.SimplePresence now has a
  MaximumStatusMessageLength property. (fd.o#33054, André)

• SimplePresence defines two new well-known status identifiers: "pstn"
  and "chat". (fd.o#36159, Danni vs. Will)

Fixes:

• Protocol.Interface.Avatars properties are documented to be immutable.
  (Guillaume)

• The tables in SimplePresence and Call's HTML documentation look nicer.

telepathy-spec 0.22.1 (2011-03-30)
==================================

The “we can change the things we know” release.

Unconventionally, this release in the 0.22 stable series of the
specification contains minor API additions. This is not intended to
become a trend; once major changes land in the specification and a
release is made in the 0.23.x unstable series, no new API will be added
to the stable branch.

• A new error code, InsufficientBalance, has been added, along with a
  balance-required key for the CallStateDetails dictionary. (Danni)

• Media.StreamHandler has grown two new method/signal pairs, namely
  SetRemoteFeedbackMessages/SupportedFeedbackMessages and
  SetRemoteHeaderExtensions/SupportedHeaderExtensions, plus some related
  types, for enabling exciting RTP header extensions and RTCP feedback
  messages.

telepathy-spec 0.22.0 (2011-03-21)
==================================

The “literate small talk” release.

This is a new stable version of telepathy-spec, intended to serve as a
reference point for future work. There were no API changes since
development release 0.21.13; significant additions and changes to
non-DRAFT interfaces from the year-and-a-half of development since
0.20.0 are summarized below.

The versions of libraries, connection managers and Mission Control
recommended for use with GNOME 3.0 (such as the upcoming telepathy-glib
0.14) can be expected to support most of the API from this spec release.

Changes to existing API
-----------------------

• Handles are no longer expected to be reference-counted - instead, they
  persist as long as the Connection does. A new property,
  HasImmortalHandles, indicates whether this is the case. Versions of
  telepathy-glib since 0.13.8 implement these semantics, and set that
  property, automatically for most connection managers.

• message-token has been redefined from "globally unique"
  to "whatever's in the underlying protocol", replacing the unimplemented
  protocol-token. This makes it feasible to implement message-token again.
  Note that connection managers implementing message-token should not be
  backported to Maemo 5, since its event logger assumes that message-token
  is guaranteed to be unique, which is usually unimplementable.

• The Messages interface is now mandatory for Text channels.

Enhancements to core API
------------------------

• The Connection has a pair of new methods, AddClientInterest and
  RemoveClientInterest, to allow clients to subscribe to potentially
  bandwidth-costly interfaces (such as MailNotification) in a generic
  way.

• ChannelDispatcher and ChannelRequest now support "request hints"
  (metadata passed through from the requester to the handler), and the
  SucceededWithChannel signal.

New optional interfaces
-----------------------

• The ContactList and ContactGroups interfaces for
  connections are now considered stable, and a new ContactBlocking
  interface has been added. Between them, these interfaces replace
  ContactList channels.

• The Connection.Interface.ClientTypes,
  Connection.Interface.MailNotification,
  Connection.Interface.Powersaving, and Protocol.Interface.Presence
  interfaces are now considered stable.

• Chan.T.ServerAuthentication and Chan.I.SASLAuthentication provide
  interactive querying for credentials, allowing connection without
  saving a password if there is a handler for these channels

• Chan.I.Securable indicates whether a channel is secure

• Account.Interface.Addressing stores user preferences for use of
  accounts for non-primary protocols, such as using SIP for telephony.

Enhancements to optional interfaces
-----------------------------------

• Add a FileTransfer.URI property which can be used to tell other
  Telepathy clients about the location of the transferred
  file.

Changes since 0.21.13
---------------------

• A server-message key for the Details dictionary in the ConnectionError
  signal has been defined. (wjt)
