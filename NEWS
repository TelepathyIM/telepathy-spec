telepathy-spec 0.21.5 (UNRELEASED)
==================================

Changes to stable API:

• fd.o #29376: Chan.T.Text now requires Chan.I.Messages (cassidy, smcv)

• fd.o #23155: message-token has been redefined from "globally unique"
  to "whatever's in the underlying protocol", replacing the unimplemented
  protocol-token. This makes it feasible to implement message-token again.
  Note that connection managers implementing message-token should not be
  backported to Maemo 5, since its event logger assumes that message-token
  is guaranteed to be unique, which is usually unimplementable. (wjt)

Deprecations:

• Most of Chan.T.Text has been superseded by Chan.I.Messages and so is now
  deprecated (smcv)

• GetPendingMessageContent is deprecated (wjt)

New stable API:

• fd.o #14003: Chan.T.ServerAuthentication and Chan.I.SASLAuthentication
  provide interactive querying for credentials, allowing connection without
  saving a password if there is a handler for these channels (eeejay, smcv,
  jonny)

• Chan.I.Securable indicates whether a channel is secure (smcv, jonny)

• fd.o #28866: ChannelDispatcher and ChannelRequest now support
  "request hints" (metadata passed through from the requester to the handler),
  and the SucceededWithChannel signal (wjt, smcv)

• fd.o #20775: Protocol.I.Avatars indicates the expected requirements for
  avatars (eeejay)
  · no changes since draft 1

• message-sender-id key in Messages headers, complementing
  message-sender (smcv)

• Messages.MessageTypes property, superseding GetMessageTypes (smcv)

• Contact_Info_Field_Flag_Overwritten_By_Nickname, indicating that this
  field will be overwritten when we set the nickname (jonner)

• Account.I.Addressing stores user preferences for use of accounts for
  non-primary protocols, such as using SIP for telephony (fledermaus)

• fd.o #29914: Conn.I.Powersaving allows connections to be placed in a
  lower-power-consumption state when a portable device is not in active use
  · no changes since draft 1

• new errors: Confused, ServerConfused (smcv)

Fixes and clarifications:

• fd.o #27183: mutual subscription is a job for servers or UIs, and should not
  be enforced by CMs (smcv)

• MIME types produced by CMs must be lower-case; MIME types provided by
  clients should be normalized to lower-case before comparison (mikhailz)

• Improve wording of requestability templates and add markup for
  sometimes-requestable properties (wjt)

• fd.o #29560: clarify how Messages signals errors (smcv)

• fd.o #29474: adjust TargetHandleType and Chan.T.Text documentation to
  reflect the Conference-based approach to MSN used since 0.20 (smcv)

• Delete unused code-generation tools and their tests, and various outdated
  documents (smcv)

• Update test-specparser.py so it actually passes, and run it in
  "make check" (smcv)

• fd.o #31661: editorial improvements (wjt)

Changes to experimental API:

• Hints and SucceededWithChannel moved to ChannelDispatcher.I.Hints and
  ChannelRequest.I.Hints

• More Call changes (jonny, sjoerd, danni)

  · fd.o #28725: add InitialTransport
  · fd.o #28690: add PleaseRestartICE and document ICE restarts

==================================

The "it's Wednesday, so this must be a spec release" release.

Changes to stable API:

  accounts that are offline or don't support SimplePresence (smcv)

  since draft 1, and the 'game' and 'sms' client types removed pending
  XMPP Registrar inclusion (jonny)

• The Access_Control_Type enum is a superset of
  Rich_Presence_Access_Control_Type, which it will supersede in future
  interfaces; similarly, Access_Control supersedes
  Rich_Presence_Access_Control (eeejay)

New experimental API:

• Conn.I.CommunicationPolicy allows incoming channels from particular
  contacts to be forbidden (eeejay)

==================================

The "I can't build there!" release.

Fixes:

• Correct the tp:name-for-bindings on ServerCertificate to be
  Server_Certificate, leading to the intended names (server_certificate
  rather than servercertificate, etc.) in generated bindings. (smcv)

telepathy-spec 0.20.0 (2010-09-14)
==================================

This is a new stable version of telepathy-spec, intended to serve as a
reference point for future work. There were no API changes since development
release 0.19.13; changes from the year of development since 0.18.0 are
summarized below.

The versions of libraries, connection managers and Mission Control recommended
for use with GNOME 2.32 (the upcoming telepathy-glib 0.12, telepathy-gabble 0.10
and Mission Control 5.6 stable branches) can be expected to support most of
the API from this spec release.

Semantic changes
----------------

• The timestamps used for "user action time", intended for focus-stealing
  prevention, are no longer interpreted as seconds since 1970. Instead, they
  should be interpreted as X-server time on X GUI platforms,
  with two special values (0 and the maximum 64-bit signed integer) having
  their own semantics.

Enhancements to core API
------------------------

• Connection now has Status, Interfaces properties
• ConnectionManager now has Protocol objects with more information about
  protocols (at the time of release, this is supported in telepathy-gabble
  0.9.x but not in most other connection managers)
• Account.ChangingPresence indicates when changes are being attempted
• Account.Service indicates a specific service such as "google-talk"
• Account has extensible details of the last connection error
• Observers can have a Recover flag, which provides best-effort crash recovery
• ChannelDispatchOperation.HandleWithTime can pass through a timestamp for
  focus-stealing prevention
• various new error codes

New optional interfaces
-----------------------

• Account.I.Storage indicates which backend an account is stored in
• Conn.I.Anonymity, Chan.I.Anonymity — controlling caller-ID and similar
  features
• Conn.I.Balance — machine-readable account balance, e.g. SkypeOut credit
• Conn.I.Cellular — extra information about cellular connections
• Conn.I.ContactInfo — information that contacts provide about themselves,
  in a vCard-like format
• Conn.I.ServicePoint, Chan.I.ServicePoint — emergency contact points
• Chan.T.ServerTLSConnection — interactive approval of any problematic
  TLS/SSL certificates
• Chan.T.ContactSearch — searching for contacts by name, address etc.
• Chan.I.Conference — multi-user text or media conferences
  which can be made by merging or upgrading 1-1 channels
• Chan.I.SMS — SMS-specific extensions to Text channels (currently only
  one property, indicating class 0 "flash" SMSs)

Enhancements to optional interfaces
-----------------------------------

• chat states are state-recoverable
• a new flag indicates whether Location can be set

Changes since 0.19.13
---------------------

• improve wording of experimental Conn.I.ClientTypes and Conn.I.PowerSaving
  interfaces (danni, wjt)
