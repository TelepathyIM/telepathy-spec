Telepathy 0.99.8 (2014-03-19)
=============================

The “like spinning plates” release.

API breaks:

• Account.AccountPropertyChanged has been replaced with
  the standard o.fd.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged

• Handle_Type is now Entity_Type, and all uses of the term have also been
  renamed (TargetEntityType, etc.)

• HandleChannel's Requests_Satisfied parameter has changed from ao
  (array of object path) to a{oa{sv}} (map from object path to its immutable
  properties), replacing Handler_Info["request-properties"]. Observer
  has had a similar change.

Deleted draft API that never had a satisfactory implementation:

• Account.I.ExternalPasswordStorage1
• Channel.I.CredentialsStorage1
• CM.I.AccountStorage1

Additions:

• The Logger's D-Bus API is now part of the main spec.

Telepathy 0.99.7 (2014-01-29)
=============================

The “jigsaw falling into place” release.

API breaks:

• Client API (Observer, ChannelDispatchOperation and Handler) are now channel
  singular. (fd.o #69430, Simon)

• Connection.NewChannels has been replaced by NewChannel (fd.o #69430, Simon)

• Connection.Requests.RequestableChannelClasses has been moved to Connection
 (fd.o #69430, Guillaume)

• ChannelDispatchOperation.HandleWithTime() has been merged into
  HandleWith().

• Handler.HandleWith::User_Action_Time: use a signed type.

• Channel.I.DTMF has been removed and re-implemented into Content.I.DTMF and
  Channel.T.Call. (fd.o #46443, Simon)

• Account.I.Hidden, AccountManager.I.Hidden have been removed
  (fd.o #33101, Simon)

Telepathy 0.99.6 (2014-01-13)
=============================

The “little by little” release.

API breaks:

• all remaining functionality of Connection.I.Contacts has moved to
  the core Connection interface (fd.o #50093, Simon)

• the Connection.I.Requests interface is still separate (so that its
  signals do not wake up uninterested clients), but is implicitly present
  and so no longer needs to be listed in Connection.Interfaces (fd.o #50093,
  Simon)

Other changes:

• X-TELEPATHY-PASSWORD is not mandatory if unimplementable (fd.o #64354, Simon)

Telepathy 0.99.5 (2013-11-11)
=============================

The “high and dry” release.

API breaks:

• All D-Bus namespaces have changed from im.telepathy1 to im.telepathy.v1

• The Renaming1.Renamed signal carries the identifier, not just the handle

• .manager and .client files go in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/telepathy-1 instead
  of $XDG_DATA_DIRS/telepathy, to be parallel-installable with Telepathy 0

New stable API:

• IRCCommand1 is marked as stable

Telepathy 0.99.4 (2013-10-29)
=============================

New stable API:

• Conn.I.Renaming, as implemented in telepathy-idle since 2007

• Chan.T.FileTransfer.FileCollection property, as implemented under a
  different interface name in telepathy-gabble since 0.10

• CD.I.Messages1, as implemented under a different interface name
  in telepathy-mission-control since 5.8

• Conn.I.Sidecars1, as implemented under a different interface name
  in telepathy-gabble and telepathy-salut

• Conn.I.IRC_Command1, a new interface to send arbitrary IRC commands to the
  server

Telepathy 0.99.3 (2013-10-28)
=============================

• Conn.I.Renaming is now considered as stable.

Telepathy 0.99.2 (2013-09-27)
=============================

The “no surprises” release.

• Connection manager names may now start with an underscore, because
  there's no reason not to (the relevant D-Bus constructs all allow it).

Telepathy 0.99.1 (2013-09-17)
=============================

The “house of cards” release.

This is the first snapshot towards Telepathy 1, a new major version of
Telepathy. It is not usable yet - we're releasing this snapshot so we
have a reference point for converting everything else.

The aims of Telepathy 1 include:

• Don't have many deprecated ways to do the same thing
• Reduce complexity
• Increase agility by making it less painful to add D-Bus API
• Increase agility by making it less painful to break D-Bus API -
  it shouldn't take 8 years to get from Telepathy 1 to Telepathy 2

We're not there yet, but we're getting there.

Major changes:

• The top-level namespace org.freedesktop.Telepathy is now the much
  shorter im.telepathy1

• A few interfaces are considered to be "core". After Telepathy
  1 becomes stable, they will only break API in a new major version
  (im.telepathy2):

  · Account, Connection, Channel and other "top-level" objects
  · Channel.Type.Text

• The majority of interfaces are considered to be "extra". If we make
  incompatible changes to them, we'll renumber them (e.g.
  Channel.Type.Call1 might be replaced by Channel.Type.Call2 in future).

• InspectHandles no longer exists, and anything that gives a handle should
  also give an identifier.

• RequestHandles no longer exists, superseded by GetContactAttributes,
  GetContactByID or by requesting a Room channel by its TargetID.

• The Text and Messages interfaces have been turned into a unified
  Text interface, whose API is basically the old Messages interface.

Smaller changes:

• "valid Accounts" are now "usable Accounts" to avoid clashing with
  the idea of proxy objects' validity, or weak pointers' validity

• various data-types related to SimplePresence have dropped the "Simple"
  prefix

• Protocol names and Service names may now contain underscores, but not
  hyphen-minus (so telepathy-salut implements local_xmpp, not local-xmpp,
  while telepathy-gabble now communicates with services that include
  google_talk, lj_talk and windows_live)

• There are no more 16-bit integers, even for port numbers. We use
  32- or 64-bit integers throughout.

• ChannelDispatcher.CreateChannel, EnsureChannel are similar to the old
  CreateChannelWithHints, EnsureChannelWithHints, but they also
  return the ChannelRequest's immutable properties. The versions with
  fewer arguments have been removed.

• Group.MembersChanged now has the same arguments previously used by
  MembersChangedDetailed, which has been deleted.

• ChannelRequest.Succeeded has the extra arguments previously in
  SucceededWithHints, which has been deleted.

• Conn.I.ContactList.ContactsChanged has the extra arguments previously in
  ContactsChangedWithID, which has been deleted.

• Client names may start with underscores

• Access_Control_Type_Group takes a string group name, not a handle.

• AliasesChanged contains a map from contact handle to alias,
  not an array of pairs.

Deprecated things that were deleted include:

• "Telepathy Properties" (replaced by standard D-Bus properties)

• Capabilities (replaced by ContactCapabilities)

• Presence (replaced by SimplePresence)

• StreamedMedia channels (replaced by Call channels)

• ContactList channels (replaced by Conn.I.ContactList, Conn.I.ContactGroups)
  and Handles of type LIST or GROUP

• Tubes channels (replaced by StreamTube, DBusTube channels)

• Many methods of the form GetFoo() (replaced by corresponding properties,
  or by GetContactAttributes)

• ChannelHandler

• HoldHandles, ReleaseHandles

• ListChannels, NewChannel, RequestChannel (replaced by Conn.I.Requests)

• Various interfaces that never got beyond draft status
