      <tp:docstring>
        THIS METHOD IS DEPRECATED AND SHOULD NOT BE USED. Instead the Error
        function should be used on the relevant MediaStreamHandler objects.
        Informs the connection manager that an error occured in this session.
        If used, the connection manager must terminate the session and all of
        the streams within it, and may also emit a StreamError signal on the
        channel for each stream within the session.
      </tp:docstring>

        Emitted when a new stream handler has been created for this
        session.

        Parameters:
        stream_handler - an object path to a new MediaStreamHandler
        id - the unique ID of the new stream
        media_type - enum for type of media that this stream should handle
