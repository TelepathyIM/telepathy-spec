      <p>A channel request is an object in the ChannelDispatcher representing
        an ongoing request for some channels to be created or found. There
        can be any number of ChannelRequest objects at the same time.</p>

      <p>Its well-known bus name is the same as that of the ChannelDispatcher,
        "org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatcher".</p>

        <p>See
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">ChannelDispatcher.DRAFT.CreateChannel</tp:dbus-ref>

        <p>The time at which user action occurred, or 0 if this channel
