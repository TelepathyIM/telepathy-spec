      <p>A channel interface for SASL authentication channels that can save the
        credentials in the connection manager.</p>

      <p>This interface is unlikely to be present for any SASL channels that are
        more complex than a simple password prompt (e.g.
        <code>X-TELEPATHY-PASSWORD</code> or <code>PLAIN</code>).</p>

      <p>In practice, this interface should only be implemented by connection
        managers that implement the <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="imt1">ConnectionManager.Interface.AccountStorage1</tp:dbus-ref>
        interface. To clear a password that has been saved in this manner, a
        client should call <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="imt1.ConnectionManager.Interface">AccountStorage1.ForgetCredentials</tp:dbus-ref>
        on the Account.</p>

      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>This method tells the connection manager whether to store the
          authentication response in order to allow the connection manager to
          sign-on automatically in the future.</p>
        <p>If credentials have been stored in this way, the client SHOULD NOT
          attempt to store the credentials locally in a keyring.</p>
        <p>This method MUST be called before <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="im.telepathy1.Channel.Interface.SASLAuthentication1">AcceptSASL</tp:dbus-ref>
          is called or it will have no effect.</p>
