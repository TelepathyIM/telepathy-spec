      <p>An interface for connections where it is possible to know what channel
        types may be created before the request is made to the connection
        object. Each capability represents a commitment by the connection
        manager that it will ordinarily be able to create a channel when given
        a request with the given type and handle.</p>

      <p>Capabilities pertain to particular contact handles, and represent
        activities such as having a text chat or a voice call with the user.
        The activities are represented by the D-Bus interface name of the
        channel type for that activity, and channel properties which can be
        requested.</p>

      <!-- Not yet spec'ed

      <p>This interface also provides for user interfaces notifying the
        connection manager of what capabilities to advertise for the user. This
        is done by using the AdvertiseContactCapabilities method, and deals with
        the interface names of channel types and the channel properties values 
        pertaining to them which are implemented by available client
        processes.</p>
