    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>This interface extends the Text interface to support messages with
        attachments (like MIME multipart/mixed) and alternatives (like MIME
        multipart/alternative); it also provides a hook for improved sent
        message status notification, to be used by a future
        DeliveryNotification interface.</p>

      <p>Although this specification supports formatted (rich-text)
        messages with unformatted alternatives, implementations SHOULD NOT
        attempt to use formatted messages until the Telepathy specification
        has also been extended to cover capability discovery for message
        formatting.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        We intend to expose all rich-text messages as XHTML-IM, but on some
        protocols, formatting is an extremely limited subset of that format
        (e.g. there are protocols where foreground/background colours, font
        and size can be set, but only for entire messages).
        Until we can tell UIs what controls to offer to the user, it's
        unfriendly to offer the user controls that may have no effect.
