        <p>Flags representing capabilities provided by a connection manager.
          Those values can be used as bitfield. Some flags depends or
          conflicts with each others. Those relations implies four
          different groups of protocols. While it's not mandatory, it is
          strongly advised that <tt>Supports_Request_Inbox_URL</tt> flag is
          supported to ensure that there always exists a way to open unread
          messages.</p>

        <p>1) Supports_Unread_Mail_Count only
          <tp:rationale>This flag is generally combined with other flags but
            still make sense alone. This is supported by most protocols
            including MSN, Yahoo and Google Talk. It allows a UI to display
            messages like 'GMail: 4 unread messages'.
          </tp:rationale>
        </p>

        <p>2) Emist_Mails_Received only
          <tp:rationale>This is the lowest level of mail notification support.
            It does not allow tracking information about the mail account. No
            supported protocol has this limited set of feature, but it is
            usefull while integrating external IM library with limited
            support of abstracted protocols (like libpurple where
            unread mail count is broken).
          </tp:rationale>
        </p>

        <p>3) Supports_Unread_Mail_Count and Supports_Unread_Mails
          <tp:rationale>This allow full state recovery of unread mail status.
            It is provided by Google XMPP Mail Notification Extension.
          </tp:rationale>
        </p>

        <p>4) Supports_Unread_Mail_Count and Emits_Mails_Received
          <tp:rationale>This is the most common level of support, it is
            provided by protocols like MSN and Yahoo.

      <tp:docstring>
        <p>This method subscribes a client to the notification interface. This
          must be called by clients before using this interface.</p>

        <p>The CM tracks a subscription count (like a refcount) for each
          unique bus name that has called Subscribe(). When a client calls
          Unsubscribe(), it releases one "reference". If a client exits
          (or crash), it releases all of its "references".</p>

        <tp:rationale>
            The reference count imposed on the subscription should simplify
            implementation of connection manager with plug-ins. Two plug-ins
            interested in mail notification may call Subscribe independently
            without relying on the CM to handle this particular action.
        </tp:rationale>

        <tp:rationale>
            This method exists to initiate real time messages in the case
            at least one client is subscribed. This may also be used to reduce
            memory and network overhead when there is no active subscription.
            An example of protocol that benifits from this method is the
            Google XMPP Mail Notification extension. In this protocol, the CM
            receives a notification telling that something has changed. To get
            more information, the CM must request this information. Knowing
            that nobody is currently interested in this information, the CM
            can avoid generating useless network traffic. In the same situation,
            the CM may free the list of unread messages and reduce memory
            overhead.

        This method unsubscribes a client from the notification interface.

          When the last client unsubscribe from this interface, the CM may
          free any uneeded data and reduce network traffic. See

        This method creates and returns an URL and an optionnal POST data that

        contains token with short lifetime. Thus, a client should not reuse it
        and request a new URL whenever it is needed. This method is implemented

    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>An interface to support receiving notifications about a e-mail
        account associated with this connection. It is intended that the
        connection manager has the means to provide necessary
        information (URL, method, POST data) so that the client is
        able to open the user's inbox and possibly individual messages without
        having to re-authenticate. To use this interface, a client must first
        subscribe using the <tp:member-ref>Subscribe</tp:member-ref>
        method.</p>

      <p>When unread e-mails arrive into the into or unread e-mails are marked
        read or deleted the
        <tp:member-ref>UnreadMailsChanged</tp:member-ref> signal
        will be emitted with the new value of
        <tp:member-ref>UnreadMailCount</tp:member-ref>, an array
        of new or modified mails and the list of removed e-mail unique IDs.
        To open the web base mail client for the inbox folder or a specific
        mail client must call <tp:member-ref>RequestInboxURL</tp:member-ref>
        or <tp:member-ref>RequestMailURL</tp:member-ref>. Those methods
        will do proper actions to retreive the information and provide
        authentication free URL to the requested Web client interface.</p>

      <p>Some protocol may not be able to provide a list of unread e-mails
        but may provide some information about the messages received. On
        such protocols, the <tp:member-ref>MailsReceived</tp:member-ref>
        signal will also be emitted, with information about the e-mails.
        The protocol does not keep track of any of this information.</p>
