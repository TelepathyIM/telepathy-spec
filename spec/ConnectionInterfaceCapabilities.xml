  <interface name="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection.Interface.Capabilities" tp:name-const="CONN_INTERFACE_CAPABILITIES">
    <method name="AdvertiseCapabilities">
      <arg direction="in" name="add" type="a(su)"/>
      <arg direction="in" name="remove" type="as"/>
      <arg direction="out" type="a(su)"/>
      <tp:docstring>
        Used by user interfaces to indicate which channel types they are able
        to handle on this connection. Because these may be provided by
        different client processes, this method accepts channel types to add
        and remove from the set already advertised on this connection. The type
        of advertised capabilities (create versus invite) is protocol-dependent
        and hence cannot be set by the this method. In the case of a client
        adding an already advertised channel type but with new channel type
        specific flags, the connection manager should simply add the new flags
        to the set of advertised capabilities.

        Upon a successful invocation of this method, the CapabilitiesChanged
        signal will be emitted for the user's own handle (as returned by
        GetSelfHandle) the by the connection manager to indicate the changes
        that have been made.  This signal should also be monitored to ensure
        that the set is kept accurate - for example, a client may remove
        capabilities or type specific capability flags when it exits
        which are still provided by another client.

        Parameters:
        add - an array of structures containing:
            a string channel type
            a bitwise OR of type specific capability flags
        remove - an array of D-Bus interface names of channel types to remove

        Returns:
        an array of structures describing the current capabilities containing:
            a string channel type
            a bitwise OR of type specific capability flags

        Potential Errors:
        NetworkError, Disconnected

    </method>
    <signal name="CapabilitiesChanged">
      <arg name="caps" type="a(usuuuu)"/>
      <tp:docstring>
        Announce that there has been a change of capabilities on the
        given handle, or on the connection itself if the handle is zero.

        Parameters:
        an array of structures containing:
            an integer handle representing the contact
            a string channel type
            a bitwise OR of the contact's old generic capability flags
            a bitwise OR of the contact's new generic capability flags
            a bitwise OR of the contact's old type specific capability flags
            a bitwise OR of the contact's new type specific capability flags
      </tp:docstring>
    </signal>
    <method name="GetCapabilities">
      <arg direction="in" name="handles" type="au"/>
      <arg direction="out" type="a(usuu)"/>
      <tp:docstring>
        Returns an array of capabilities for the given contact handles, or
        the connection itself (where handle is zero).

        Parameters:
        handle - a contact handle for this connection, or zero for channel types available on the connection itself

        Returns:
        an array of structures containing:
            an integer handle representing the contact
            a string channel type
            a bitwise OR of generic capability flags for the type
            a bitwise OR of type specific capability flags for the type

        Possible Errors:
        Disconnected, NetworkError, InvalidHandle (the handle does not represent a contact), PermissionDenied
      </tp:docstring>
    </method>
    <tp:docstring>
      An interface for connections where it is possible to know what channel
    types may be requested before the request is made to the connection object.
    Each capability represents a commitment by the connection manager that it
    will ordinarily be able to create a channel when given a request with the
    given type and handle.

    Capabilities can pertain to a certain contact handle, representing
    activities such as having a text chat or a voice call with the user, or can
    be on the connection itself (where the handle will be zero), where they
    represent the ability to create channels for chat rooms or activities such
    as searching and room listing. The activities are represented by the D-Bus
    interface name of the channel type for that activity.

    The following generic capability flags are defined:
    1 - CONNECTION_CAPABILITY_FLAG_CREATE
        The given channel type and handle can be given to RequestChannel to
        create a new channel of this type.
    2 - CONNECTION_CAPABILITY_FLAG_INVITE
        The given contact can be invited to an existing channel of this type.

    In addition, channel types may have type specific capability flags of their
    own, which are described in the documentation for each channel type.

    This interface also provides for user interfaces notifying the connection
    manager of what capabilities to advertise for the user. This is done by
    using the AdvertiseCapabilities method, and deals with the interface names
    of channel types and the type specific flags pertaining to them which are
    implemented by available client processes.
