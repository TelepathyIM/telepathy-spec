      <p>Channel handlers are the eventual handler for a channel or a
        channel bundle; a typical channel handler is a user interface
        process handling channels of a particular type.</p>

    <property name="HandlerChannelFilter" type="v">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>A specification of the channels that this channel handler can
          deal with. It will be offered to approvers as a potential
          channel handler for bundles that contain only suitable channels,
          or for suitable channels that must be handled separately.</p>

        <p>For channel handlers that have a .client file, the channel
          dispatcher may discover this property from the
          [org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.ChannelHandler.DRAFT] section of
          the .client file. (FIXME: what are the keys and their values?)</p>

        <p>FIXME: the type 'v' is a placeholder and needs replacing with
          something suitable.</p>

        <p>Present any user interface for the given channels to the user, i.e.
          bring it to the foreground, give it focus, or use some other way to
          bring it to the user's attention.</p>

        <p>This method is called by the channel dispatcher if existing
          channels are re-requested. As a result, it SHOULD only ever be
          called in response to user action, which means that the client
          MAY take input focus as a result.</p>

        <p>If any of the given channels are not being handled by this
          channel handler, they MUST be ignored. The channel dispatcher
          MAY include channels in the argument even if this channel
          handler is not actually handling them, but SHOULD NOT call this
          method unless the channel handler is actually handling at least
          one of the channels.</p>
