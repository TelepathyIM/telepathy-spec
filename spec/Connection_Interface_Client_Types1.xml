    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>An interface on connections to support protocols which allows users to
        subscribe to the client types of their contacts.</p>

      <p>One can connect to instant messaging networks on a huge variety of
        devices, from PCs, to phones to consoles. It can be useful for users
        to know what kind of device a contact is using so that he or she
        can decide not to send that big file or start a video chat. This
        interface exposes exactly this information for clients to display.</p>

      <p>The client types are represented in strings, using the values
        <a href="http://xmpp.org/registrar/disco-categories.html#client">
        documented by the XMPP registrar</a> with some additional types
        added for other protocols. A contact can set one or more client types
        so this interface returns a list of strings to denote client types
        for a contact. The well-known client types to be used are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>bot</li>
        <li>console (minimal non-GUI client used on dumb terminals or
          text-only screens, <strong>not</strong> a games console)</li>
        <li>handheld</li>
        <li>pc</li>
        <li>phone</li>
        <li>web</li>
<!-- Excluding these two because there's been no conclusion regarding my mail
     to standards@xmpp.org about adding these two to their list:

        <li>sms (the client is not actually an instant messaging client
          but all messages sent to this contact will be delivered as SMSs)</li>
        <li>game (a gaming device)</li>
-->
      </ul>

      <p>If the empty list is given as the client types, this means that
        details about the contact's client types are unknown. If there are
        multiple resources of a contact online at one point in time, the
        client types of the most available resource will be returned. In
        other words, the returned client types are those for the resource whose
        presence will be retreived using the
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="imt1.Connection.Interface">Presence1</tp:dbus-ref>
        interface.</p>

      <p>For example, if a contact has two resources:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>their phone, with presence "available"; and</li>
        <li>their pc, with presence "busy";</li>
      </ul>

      <p>then the methods in this interface will return an array (with
      one element: "phone") as the client types because that is the more
      available resource. If at some later time the contact's phone's presence
      changes to "away", the
      <tp:member-ref>ClientTypesUpdated</tp:member-ref> signal will
      notify that the contact's client types attribute has changed from
      ["phone"] to ["pc"],
      because "busy" is a more available presence than "away".</p>

          This method is appropriate for use in a "Contact Information..."
          dialog; it can be used to show progress information (while waiting
          for the method to return), and can distinguish between various error
          conditions.
