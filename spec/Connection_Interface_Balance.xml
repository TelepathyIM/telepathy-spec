      <p>In many real-time communication services the user can pay for certain
        services, typically calls to the
        <abbr title="Public Switched Telephone Network">PSTN</abbr>,
        in advance. In (at least) Skype, it's possible to query the current
        balance in a machine-readable way.</p>

      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>An amount of money in a specified currency. For example,
          3.21 British pounds would conventionally be represented by
          (Amount = 321, Scale = 2, Currency = "GBP"), but could be
          represented by (Amount = 3210, Scale = 3, Currency = "GBP")
          in a service that records balance in units of 0.001 pounds.</p>

        <p>As a special case, if Amount = 0, Scale = 2**32 and Currency = "",
          this indicates an unknown amount.</p>

            1234 with Scale of 2 represents 12.34 in the currency unit given

          <p>As well as defining the interpretation of Amount, user interfaces
