      <p>Channel handlers are the eventual handler for a channel or a
        channel bundle; a typical channel handler is a user interface
        process handling channels of a particular type.</p>

      <p>When a new incoming channel (one with
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.FUTURE">Requested</tp:dbus-ref>
        = TRUE) is offered to
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client">Approver</tp:dbus-ref>s
        by the channel dispatcher, it also offers the Approvers a list of all
        the running or activatable ChannelHandlers whose
        <tp:member-ref>HandlerChannelFilter</tp:member-ref> property
        (possibly as cached in the .client file) indicates that they
        are able to handle the channel. The Approvers can choose one of
        those channel handlers to handle the channel.</p>

      <p>When a new outgoing channel (one with
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.FUTURE">Requested</tp:dbus-ref>
        = FALSE) appears, the channel dispatcher passes it to an appropriate
        channel handler automatically.

        <p>A specification of the channels that this channel handler can
          deal with. It will be offered to approvers as a potential
          channel handler for bundles that contain only suitable channels,
          or for suitable channels that must be handled separately.</p>

        <p>This property works in exactly the same way as the
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Client.Observer.DRAFT.ObserverChannelFilter</tp:dbus-ref>
          property. In the .client file, it is represented in the
          same way as ObserverChannelFilter, but the group has the same
          name as this interface and the keys start with
          HandlerChannelFilter instead of ObserverChannelFilter.</p>

      return instantly, and if successful, fast-tracks the channels past any

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>Clients are expected to know what channels they're already handling,
            and which channel object path corresponds to which window or tab.

          <p>If the channel dispatcher is automatically replaced, the
            replacement can discover all Handlers by looking for the Client
            well-known bus names, and discover which channels they are
            currently handling. Once this has been done, all unhandled
            channels can be re-dispatched, and the only issue visible to
            the user is that unhandled channels that they have already
            approved might be sent back to Approvers.</p>
