      <p>This interface exists to expose security information about
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="imt1">Channel</tp:dbus-ref>s. The two
        properties are sometimes immutable and can be used to make
        decisions on how cautious to be about transferring sensitive
        data. The special case of <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace="imt1.Channel.Type">ServerAuthentication1</tp:dbus-ref>
        channels is one example of where the two properties are
        immutable.</p>

      <p>For example, clients MAY use these properties to decide
        whether the <code>PLAIN</code> mechanism is acceptable for a
        <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace="imt1.Channel.Interface">SASLAuthentication1</tp:dbus-ref>
        channel.</p>
