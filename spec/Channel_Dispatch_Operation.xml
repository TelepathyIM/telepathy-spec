  <interface name="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatchOperation.DRAFT"
    tp:causes-havoc="experimental">

    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>A channel dispatch operation is an object in the ChannelDispatcher
        representing a bundle of unrequested channels being announced to
        client processes.</p>

      <p>These objects can result from new incoming channels or channels
        which are automatically created for some reason, but cannot result
        from outgoing requests for channels.</p>

      <p>More specifically, whenever the
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Connection.Interface.Requests.DRAFT.NewChannels</tp:dbus-ref>
        signal contains channels whose
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Channel.FUTURE.Requested</tp:dbus-ref>
        property is false, or whenever the
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Connection.NewChannel</tp:dbus-ref>
        signal contains a channel with suppress_handler false,
        one or more ChannelDispatchOperation objects are created for those
        channels.</p>

      <p>(If some channels in a NewChannels signal are in different bundles,
        this is an error. The channel dispatcher SHOULD recover by treating
        the NewChannels signal as if it had been several NewChannels signals
        each containing one channel.)</p>

      <p>First, the channel dispatcher SHOULD construct a list of all the
        channel handlers that could handle all the channels, ordered by
        priority in some implementation-dependent way.</p>

      <p>If there are suitable handlers, one channel dispatch operation SHOULD
        be created for all the channels. If there are not, one channel
        dispatch operation SHOULD be created for each channel, each with
        a list of channel handlers that could handle that channel.</p>

      <p>When listing channel handlers, priority SHOULD be given to
        channel handlers that are already handling channels from the same
        bundle.</p>

      <p>Processing of a channel dispatch operation proceeds as follows.
        If the channels in a channel dispatch operation are in the same
        bundle as a channel that is already being handled, and the handler
        could also handle the channels being dispatched, the channel
        dispatcher SHOULD call the handler's
        HandleAdditionalChannels
        method to see whether the handler will accept the new channels too.
        If the handler takes responsibility for the channels,
        processing stops, and no approvers are run.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>Some channel types can be picked up "quietly" by an existing
          channel handler. If a Text channel is added to an existing
          bundle containing a StreamedMedia channel, there shouldn't be
          any approvers, flashing icons or notification bubbles, if the
          the UI for the StreamedMedia channel can just add a text box
          and display the message.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>If not, the channel dispatcher SHOULD send the channel dispatch
        operation to all relevant approvers (in parallel) and wait for an
        approver to request that the channels are handled or rejected.</p>

      <p>Finally, the channel dispatcher SHOULD send the channels to
        a handler, or reject them, according to the approver's choice.</p>
    </tp:docstring>

    <property name="Interfaces" type="as" access="read"
      tp:type="DBus_Interface[]">
      <tp:docstring>
        A list of the extra interfaces provided by this channel dispatch
        operation.

    </property>

    <method name="HandleWith">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Called by an approver to accept a channel bundle and request that
          the given handler be used to handle it.</p>

        <p>If successful, this method will cause the ChannelDispatchOperation
          object to disappear, emitting Closed, and also cause the
          ChannelDispatcher to emit DispatchOperationClosed.</p>

        <p>However, this method may fail because the dispatch has already been
          completed and the object has already gone. If this occurs, it
          indicates that another approver has asked for the bundle to be
          handled by a particular handler. The approver MUST NOT attempt
          to handle the channels itself in this case.</p>

        <p>Approvers which are also channel handlers SHOULD use HandleWith
          to request that they can handle a channel bundle themselves, but
          MUST NOT actually start to handle the channel until the
          ChannelHandler.HandleChannels method is called on them.</p>
      </tp:docstring>

      <arg direction="in" type="s" tp:type="DBus_Bus_Name" name="Handler">
        <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
          <p>The well-known bus name (starting with
            <code>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.</code>) of the channel
            handler that should handle the channel.</p>

    <method name="Reject">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Called by an approver to reject a channel bundle. This is
          equivalent to passing it to a channel handler that closes or
          ignores the channel.</p>

        <p>The channel dispatcher SHOULD use a channel-type-specific
          mechanism to close the channels if appropriate. If their channel
          types are not known to the channel dispatcher, it SHOULD leave
          the channels open but ignore them.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>The channel dispatcher can't know how best to close arbitrary
            channel types.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>If successful, this method will cause the ChannelDispatchOperation
          object to disappear. See HandleWith for more details.</p>

        <p>This method may fail because the dispatch operation has already
          been completed. Again, see HandleWith for more details. The approver
          MUST NOT attempt to close the channels itself in this case.</p>
      </tp:docstring>

    <signal name="Closed">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Emitted when this dispatch operation finishes. The dispatch
          operation is no longer present and further methods must not be
          called on it.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>Strictly speaking this is redundant with
            ChannelDispatcher.DispatchOperationClosed, but having it here
            makes the ChannelDispatchOperation self-contained.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>Its object path SHOULD NOT be reused for a subsequent dispatch
          operation; the ChannelDispatcher MUST choose object paths
          in a way that avoids immediate re-use.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>Otherwise, clients might accidentally call Claim, HandleWith
            or Reject on a new dispatch operation instead of the one they
            intended to handle.</p>
