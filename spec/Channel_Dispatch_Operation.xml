  <interface name="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatchOperation.DRAFT"
    tp:causes-havoc="experimental">

    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>A channel dispatch operation is an object in the ChannelDispatcher
        representing a bundle of unrequested channels being announced to
        client
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client">Approver.DRAFT</tp:dbus-ref>
        processes.</p>

      <p>These objects can result from new incoming channels or channels
        which are automatically created for some reason, but cannot result
        from outgoing requests for channels.</p>

      <p>More specifically, whenever the
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Connection.Interface.Requests.NewChannels</tp:dbus-ref>
        signal contains channels whose
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Channel.FUTURE.Requested</tp:dbus-ref>
        property is false, or whenever the
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Connection.NewChannel</tp:dbus-ref>
        signal contains a channel with suppress_handler false,
        one or more ChannelDispatchOperation objects are created for those
        channels.</p>

      <p>(If some channels in a NewChannels signal are in different bundles,
        this is an error. The channel dispatcher SHOULD recover by treating
        the NewChannels signal as if it had been several NewChannels signals
        each containing one channel.)</p>

      <p>First, the channel dispatcher SHOULD construct a list of all the
        channel handlers that could handle all the channels, ordered by
        priority in some implementation-dependent way. If there are handlers
        which could handle all the channels, one channel dispatch operation
        SHOULD be created for all the channels. If there are not, one channel
        dispatch operation SHOULD be created for each channel, each with
        a list of channel handlers that could handle that channel.</p>

      <p>When listing channel handlers, priority SHOULD be given to
        channel handlers that are already handling channels from the same
        bundle.</p>

      <p>Processing of a channel dispatch operation proceeds as follows.
        If the channels in a channel dispatch operation are in the same
        bundle as a channel that is already being handled, and the handler
        could also handle the channels being dispatched, the channel
        dispatcher SHOULD call the handler's
        HandleAdditionalChannels
        method to see whether the handler will accept the new channels too.
        If the handler takes responsibility for the channels,
        processing stops, and no approvers are run.</p>

      <p>(FIXME: this is far too subtle and everyone will get it wrong.
        Open issue: how else do we address this use case?)</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>Some channel types can be picked up "quietly" by an existing
          channel handler. If a Text channel is added to an existing
          bundle containing a StreamedMedia channel, there shouldn't be
          any approvers, flashing icons or notification bubbles, if the
          the UI for the StreamedMedia channel can just add a text box
          and display the message.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>If not, the channel dispatcher SHOULD send the channel dispatch
        operation to all relevant approvers (in parallel) and wait for an
        approver to claim the channels or request that they are handled.
        See
        <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Approver.DRAFT">AddDispatchOperation</tp:dbus-ref>
        for more details on this.</p>

      <p>Finally, if the approver requested it, the channel dispatcher SHOULD
        send the channels to a handler.</p>

        <p>However, this method may fail because the dispatch has already been

          separately invoked as the handler.</p>

        <p>Approvers which are also channel handlers SHOULD use Claim instead

          <em>does not</em> have the HandleChannels method called on it.</p>
        <!-- FIXME: tp:dbus-ref -->

        <p>Clients that call Claim on a channel and do not immediately
          close it SHOULD implement the Handler interface and its
          CurrentlyHandledChannels property.</p>
        <!-- FIXME: tp:dbus-ref -->

        <p>Approvers wishing to reject a channel MUST call this method to
          claim ownership of it, and MUST NOT call
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel">Close</tp:dbus-ref>
          on the channel unless this method returns successfully.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>The channel dispatcher can't know how best to close arbitrary
            channel types (for instance, for Text channels it is necessary
            to acknowledge any messages that have already been displayed to
            the user first), so it leaves it up to the approver to do so.</p>

        <p>If successful, this method will cause the ChannelDispatchOperation
          object to disappear, emitting
          <tp:member-ref>Closed</tp:member-ref>, in the same way as for
          <tp:member-ref>HandleWith</tp:member-ref>.</p>

        <p>This method may fail because the dispatch operation has already
          been completed. Again, see HandleWith for more details. The approver
          MUST NOT attempt to interact with the channels further in this
          case.</p>

          operation; the ChannelDispatcher MUST choose object paths
