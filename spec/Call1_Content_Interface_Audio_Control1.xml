      <p>This interface allows the connection manager to be kept informed of,
          and control, the input and output volumes of an audio stream.
          While generally not needed, if the connection manager needs to
          handle stream volumes directly (typically when using
          <tp:value-ref>Call_Content_Packetization_Type_Raw</tp:value-ref>),
          this interface may be necessary.</p>

      <p>If this interface is present, the handler should call
          <tp:member-ref>ReportInputVolume</tp:member-ref>
          and <tp:member-ref>ReportOutputVolume</tp:member-ref> whenever the
          input and output volume change, both when the user manually modifies
          the volume and when the volumes are adjusted in response to
          <tp:member-ref>RequestedInputVolume</tp:member-ref> and
          <tp:member-ref>RequestedOutputVolume</tp:member-ref> changing.</p>

      <p>The maximum volume as used in this interface represent the unamplified
         hardware volume (0 dB). No software amplification should be used to
         boost the signal to a higher level when this Interface is in use</p>
