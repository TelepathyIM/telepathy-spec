      <p>An interface channels can implement to support subjects. Most
        of the time this will be implemented by channels implementing
        the <tp:dbus-ref
        namespace="imt1.Channel.Interface">Room1</tp:dbus-ref>
        interface, but some protocols support subjects in 1-to-1 chats
        (such as XMPP). Note that this interface is not restricted to
        Text channels, and can also be used on Call channels.</p>

        <p>A successful return of this method indicates a successful

        <tp:rationale>This property replaces the subject Telepathy
          property of Text channels, as Telepathy properties are soon to
          be deprecated completely.</tp:rationale>

        <p>If implementations are unsure of what this value should be

        <tp:rationale>In XMPP it is impossible to know whether an

          are wildly inconsistent.</tp:rationale>
