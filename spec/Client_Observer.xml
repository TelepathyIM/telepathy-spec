      <p>Observers monitor the creation of new channels. This
        functionality can be used for things like message logging.
        All observers are notified simultaneously, and they are not
        given an opportunity to delay channel handling; they should not
        alter the state of the channel.</p>
    </tp:docstring>

    <method name="ObserveChannel">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Called by the channel dispatcher when a channel in which the
          observer has registered an interest is created.</p>

        <p>For observers that are always running, this is somewhat
          redundant, because the observer could monitor the NewChannel
          signal. However, observers can also be registered to be
          started on demand using service activation.</p>

        <p>The channel dispatcher SHOULD call this method on all observers
          at the same time, and SHOULD NOT wait for replies before proceeding.
          It MAY accept replies asynchronously for logging purposes.</p>

      <arg name="Connection" type="o" direction="in">
        <tp:docstring>
          The Connection with which the channels are associated. The
          well-known bus name to use can be derived from this object
          path by removing the leading '/' and replacing all subsequent
          '/' by '.'.

      <arg name="Channel" type="o" direction="in">
        <tp:docstring>
          The channel. Its well-known bus name is the same as that of the
          Connection.
