      <p>Observers monitor the creation of new channels. This
        functionality can be used for things like message logging.
        All observers are notified simultaneously; they should not
        alter the state of the channel.</p>

      <p>Whenever a new channel is signalled, the channel dispatcher
        notifies all running or activatable observers whose
        <tp:member-ref>ObserverChannelFilter</tp:member-ref> property
        (possibly as cached in the .client file) indicates that they are
        interested in the channel.</p>

      <p>Observers are activated for all channels in which they have
        registered an interest - incoming, outgoing or automatically created -
        although of course the ObserverChannelFilter property can be set
        to filter on the
        <!--FIXME: reinstate this when the property is merged
        <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.FUTURE">Requested</tp:dbus-ref>-->
        Channel.FUTURE.Requested
        property.</p>

    <property name="ObserverChannelFilter" type="v" access="read">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>A specification of the channels in which this observer is
          interested. The <tp:member-ref>ObserveChannel</tp:member-ref> method
          should be called by the channel dispatcher whenever a new channel
          matches this description.</p>

        <p>This property never changes while the observer process is
          running. (FIXME: it can change due to upgrades - how do we tell
          the channel dispatcher about this? Make it inotify on the .client
          file?)</p>

        <p>For observers that have a .client file, the channel dispatcher
          may discover this property from the
          [org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Observer.DRAFT] section of the
          .client file. (FIXME: what are the keys and their values?)</p>

        <p>Called by the channel dispatcher when a channel in which the
          observer has registered an interest is created.</p>

        <p>The channel dispatcher SHOULD call this method on all observers
          in parallel, and MUST wait for either a reply from all observers
          or an implementation-dependent timeout before dispatching the channel
          to a channel handler. It is implementation-dependent whether
          observers and approvers are notified in parallel.</p>

        <p>The observer MUST NOT reply to this method call until it is ready
          for the channel handler to run (which may change the channel's
          state).</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>The channel dispatcher must wait for observers to start up,
            to avoid the following race: text channel logger (observer) gets
            ObserveChannel, text channel handler gets
            <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.ChannelHandler.DRAFT">HandleChannels</tp:dbus-ref>
            channel handler starts up faster and acknowledges messages,
            logger never sees those messages.</p>
