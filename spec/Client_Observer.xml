      <p>Observers monitor the creation of new channels. This
        functionality can be used for things like message logging.
        All observers are notified simultaneously, and they are not
        given an opportunity to delay channel handling; they should not
        alter the state of the channel.</p>

      <p>Whenever a new channel is signalled, the channel dispatcher
        notifies all observers whose
        <tp:member-ref>ObserverChannelFilter</tp:member-ref> property
        indicates that they are interested in the channel.</p>
    </tp:docstring>

    <property name="ObserverChannelFilter" type="v">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>A specification of the channels in which this observer is
          interested. The <tp:member-ref>ObserveChannel</tp:member-ref> method
          should be called by the channel dispatcher whenever a new channel
          matches this description.
          </p>

        <p>For observers that have a .client file, the channel dispatcher
          may discover this property from the
          [org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Observer.DRAFT] section of the
          .client file. (FIXME: what are the keys and their values?)</p>

        <p>FIXME: the type 'v' is a placeholder and needs replacing with
          something suitable.</p>
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <method name="ObserveChannel">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Called by the channel dispatcher when a channel in which the
          observer has registered an interest is created.</p>

        <p>For observers that are always running, this is somewhat
          redundant, because the observer could monitor the NewChannel
          signal. However, observers can also be registered to be
          started on demand using service activation.</p>

        <p>The channel dispatcher SHOULD call this method on all observers
          at the same time, and SHOULD NOT wait for replies before proceeding.
          It MAY accept replies asynchronously for logging purposes.</p>

          The Connection with which the channels are associated. The

          '/' by '.'.
