    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      An interface that gives audio Contents the ability to send DTMF events
      which have been established using the Call1 channel
      type. The event codes used are in common with those defined in <a
      href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4733.txt">RFC4733</a>, and are
      listed in the <tp:type>DTMF_Event</tp:type> enumeration.
    </tp:docstring>

    <method name="StartTone" tp:name-for-bindings="Start_Tone">
      <arg direction="in" name="Event" type="y" tp:type="DTMF_Event">
        <tp:docstring>A numeric event code from the DTMF_Event enum.</tp:docstring>
      </arg>

      <tp:docstring>
        <p>Start sending a DTMF tone to all eligible streams in the channel.
          Where possible, the tone will continue until
          <tp:member-ref>StopTone</tp:member-ref> is called. On certain protocols,
          it may only be possible to send events with a predetermined length. In
          this case, the implementation MAY emit a fixed-length tone, and the
          StopTone method call SHOULD return NotAvailable.</p>
          <tp:rationale>
            The client may wish to control the exact duration and timing of the
            tones sent as a result of user's interaction with the dialpad, thus
            starting and stopping the tone sending explicitly.
          </tp:rationale>

        <p>Tone overlaping or queueing is not supported, so this method can only
          be called if no DTMF tones are already being played.</p>

        If there is no current tone, this method will do nothing.
        If MultipleTones was used, the client should not assume the
        sending has stopped immediately; instead, the client should wait
        for the StoppedTones signal.
        <tp:rationale>
          On some protocols it might be impossible to cancel queued tones
          immediately.

          <p>A string representation of one or more DTMF
            events. Implementations of this method MUST support all of the
            following characters in this string:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>the digits 0-9, letters A-D and a-d, and symbols '*' and '#'
              correspond to the members of <tp:type>DTMF_Event</tp:type></li>

            <li>any of 'p', 'P', 'x', 'X' or ',' (comma) results in an
              implementation-defined pause, typically for 3 seconds</li>

            <li>'w' or 'W' waits for the user to continue, by stopping
              interpretation of the string, and if there is more to be played,
              emitting the <tp:member-ref>TonesDeferred</tp:member-ref> signal

      <tp:docstring>
        <p>Send multiple DTMF events to all eligible streams in the channel.
        Each tone will be played for an implementation-defined number of
        milliseconds (typically 250ms), followed by a gap before the next tone
        is played (typically 100ms). The
        duration and gap are defined by the protocol or connection manager.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>In cases where the client knows in advance the tone sequence it
            wants to send, it's easier to use this method than manually start
            and stop each tone in the sequence.</p>

          <p>The tone and gap lengths may need to vary for interoperability,
            according to the protocol and other implementations' ability to
            recognise tones. At the time of writing, GStreamer uses a
            minimum of 250ms tones and 100ms gaps when playing in-band DTMF
            in the normal audio stream, or 70ms tones and 50ms gaps when
            encoding DTMF as <code>audio/telephone-event</code>.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>Tone overlaping or queueing is not supported, so this method can only
          be called if no DTMF tones are already being played.</p>
