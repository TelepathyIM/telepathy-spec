      <p>An interface for telling the connection when to enter and
      leave power saving mode.</p>

      <p>Power saving mode should be used when the user is not
        directly interacting with the interface. For example, when
        the screen saver is active, or when device screen is
        locked.</p>

      <p>Connection managers should implement this feature in a way
        that is not noticeable by end users. For example, a protocol
        might allow server-side blocking presence updates from
        contacts to reduce network chatter. This would not affect the
        user, since they are not interacting with their device when it
        is in power saving mode.</p>

    <method name="SetPowerSaving" tp:name-for-bindings="Set_Power_Saving">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Turn power saving mode on or off.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>Depending on the device's activity level, the
            connection can have it's power saving mode turned on or off.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>Errors raised by this method indicate that power saving could not be
          enabled, which SHOULD NOT generally be treated as fatal.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          If the CM cannot switch modes, either because of the
          protocol (<code>NotImplemented</code>), or because of the service
          (<code>NotAvailable</code>), Mission Control (or whoever manages this)
          should be made aware. The error could be ignored or, in the extreme,
          be fascist and disconnect the account.
