    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>This interface extends the Text interface with improved sent-message
        status reporting. Channels implementing this interface
        SHOULD also implement the MessageParts interface; clients supporting
        this interface SHOULD also have at least basic support for the
        MessageParts interface.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          This interface replaces Text.SendError, adding support for protocols
          where the message content is not echoed back to the sender on
          failure. It also adds support for receiving positive
          acknowledgements, and has properties for state recovery (ensuring
          that incoming delivery reports are not lost if there is not
          currently a process handling them).
