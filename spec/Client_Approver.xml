      <p>Approvers notify the user that new channels have been created,
        and allow the user to accept or reject those channels.</p>

      <p>They can also select which channel handler will be used for the
        channel, for instance by offering the user a list of possible
        handlers rather than just an accept/reject choice.</p>

      <p>However, the Channel Dispatcher must be able to prioritize
        possible handlers on its own using some reasonable heuristic,
        probably based on user configuration.</p>

      <p>It is possible (and useful) to have an approver and
        a channel handler in the same process; this is particularly useful
        if a channel handler wants to claim responsibility for particular
        channels itself.</p>

      <p>All approvers are notified simultaneously. For instance, in a
        desktop system, there might be one approver that displays a
        notification-area icon, one that is part of a contact list
        window and highlights contacts there, and one that is part
        of a full-screen media player.</p>

      <p>Any approver can approve the handling of a channel with a
        particular channel handler. Approvers can also request that the
        channel is rejected. The first approver to reply gets its decision
        acted on; any other approvers that reply at the same time will
        get a D-Bus error, indicating that the channel has already been
        dealt with.</p>

      <p>Approvers should usually prompt the user and ask for
        confirmation, rather than dispatching the channel to a handler
        straight away.</p>

    <property name="ApproverChannelFilter" type="aa{sv}" access="read"

      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>A specification of the channels in which this approver is
          interested. The <tp:member-ref>HandleDispatch</tp:member-ref>
          method should be called by the channel dispatcher whenever the
          channels in a channel dispatch operation
          match this description.</p>

        <p>(FIXME: what happens if some but not all of the channels
          match this?)</p>

        <p>This property works in exactly the same way as the
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Client.Observer.DRAFT.ObserverChannelFilter</tp:dbus-ref>
          property. In the .client file, it is represented in the
          same way as ObserverChannelFilter, but the group has the same
          name as this interface and the keys start with
          ApproverChannelFilter instead of ObserverChannelFilter.</p>

        <p>Called by the channel dispatcher when a ChannelDispatchOperation
          in which the approver has registered an interest is created.</p>

        <p>The channel dispatcher SHOULD call this method on all approvers
          at the same time. If no approvers return from this method
          successfully (for instance because no approvers are running),
          the channel dispatcher SHOULD consider this to be an error, and
          recover by dispatching the channel to the most preferred handler.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          Processes that aren't approvers shouldn't be making connections
          anyway - there should always be at least one approver running.
          (FIXME: or should the CD attempt to service-activate an approver?)

          The <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">ChannelDispatchOperation</tp:dbus-ref>,

          with which the channels are associated. The
          well-known bus name to use can be derived from this object
