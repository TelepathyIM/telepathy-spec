        Get a list of the parameters which must or may be provided to the
        RequestConnection method when connecting to the given protocol,
        or registering (the boolean &quot;register&quot; parameter is available, and
        set to true).

        Parameters may have the following flags:
        1 - CONN_MGR_PARAM_FLAG_REQUIRED
            This parameter is required for connecting to the server.
        2 - CONN_MGR_PARAM_FLAG_REGISTER
            This parameter is required for registering an account on the
            server.
        4 - CONN_MGR_PARAM_FLAG_HAS_DEFAULT
            This parameter has a default value, which is returned; not
            providing this parameter is equivalent to providing the default.

        Returns:
        an array of structs containing:
            a string parameter name
            a bitwise OR of the parameter flags (as defined above)
            a string D-Bus type signature
            a variant boxed default value (only relevant if the
                HAS_DEFAULT flag is present)

        Potential Errors:
        NotImplemented (the requested protocol is not supported by this manager)

    <method name="ListProtocols">

      <tp:docstring>
        Get a list of protocol identifiers that are implemented by this

         silc - SILC
         sip - Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
         trepia - Trepia
         yahoo - Yahoo! Messenger
         zephyr - Zephyr

        Returns:
        an array of string protocol identifiers supported by this manager

    <signal name="NewConnection">

      <arg name="object_path" type="o"/>
      <arg name="proto" type="s"/>
      <tp:docstring>
        Emitted when a new Connection object is created.

        Parameters:
        bus_name - the D-Bus service where the connection object can be found
        object_path - the object path of the Connection object on this service
        proto - the identifier for the protocol this connection uses
      </tp:docstring>
    </signal>
    <method name="RequestConnection">
      <arg direction="in" name="proto" type="s"/>
      <arg direction="in" name="parameters" type="a{sv}"/>
      <arg direction="out" type="s"/>
      <arg direction="out" type="o"/>
      <tp:docstring>
        Request a Connection object representing a given account on a given
        protocol with the given parameters. The method returns the bus name
        and the object path where the new Connection object can be found, which
        should have the status of CONNECTION_STATUS_DISCONNECTED, to allow
        signal handlers to be attached before connecting is started with the
        Connect method.

        In order to allow Connection objects to be discovered by new clients,
        the bus name and object path must be of the form:
         /org/freedesktop/Telepathy/Connection/manager/proto/account
        And:
         org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection.manager.proto.account
        Where manager and proto are the identifiers for this manager and this
        protocol, and account is a series of elements formed such that any
        valid distinct connection instance on this protocol has a distinct
        name. This might be formed by including the server name followed by the
        user name, or on protocols where connecting multiple times is
        permissable, a per-connection identifier is also necessary to ensure
        uniqueness.

        The parameters which must and may be provided in the parameters
        dictionary can be discovered with the GetParameters method. These
        parameters, their types, and their default values may be cached
        in files so that all available connection managers do not need to be
        started to discover which protocols are available.

        To request values for these parameters from the user, a client must
        have prior knowledge of the meaning of the parameter names, so the
        following well-known names and types should be used where appropriate:

        s:account - the identifier for the user's account on the server.

        s:server - a fully qualified domain name or numeric IPv4 or IPv6
        address. Using the fully-qualified domain name form is recommended
        whenever possible. If this parameter is specified and the account
        for that protocol also specifies a server, this parameter should
        override that in the user id.

        q:port - a TCP or UDP port number. If this parameter is specified
        and the account for that protocol also specifies a port, this
        parameter should override that in the account.

        s:password - a password associated with the account.

        b:require-encryption - require encryption for this connection. A
        connection should fail to connect if require-encryption is set
        and an encrypted connection is not possible.

        b:register - this account should be created on the server if it
        does not already exist.

        s:ident - the local username to report to the server if
        necessary, such as in IRC.

        s:fullname - the user's full name if the service requires this
        when authenticating or registering.

        Every successful RequestConnection call will cause the emission of a
        NewConnection signal for the same newly created connection. The
        requester can use the returned object path and service name
        independently of the emission of that signal. In that case this signal
        emission is most useful for, e.g. other processes that are monitoring
        the creation of new connections.

        Parameters:
        proto - the protocol identifier
        parameters - a dictionary mapping parameter name to the variant boxed value

        Returns:
        a D-Bus service name where the new Connection object can be found
        the D-Bus object path to the Connection on this service

        Potential Errors:
        NetworkError, NotImplemented (unknown protocol), NotAvailable (the requested connection already appears to exist), InvalidArgument (unrecognised connection parameters)
      </tp:docstring>
    </method>
    <tp:docstring>
      A D-Bus service which allows connections to be created. The manager
    processes are intended to be started by D-Bus service activation.  The
    names of these services, the protocols they support, and the parameters
    understood by that protocol are intended to be discovered by reading files
    on disk which are provided along with the connection manager. These are
    documented elsewhere.

    Once a connection manager service has been activated, the object
    path of the manager object implementing this interface is always:
     /org/freedesktop/Telepathy/ConnectionManager/name
    Where name is the identifier for the connection manager.

    It is not required that a connection manager be able to support multiple
    protocols, or even multiple connections. When a connection is made, a
    service name where the connection object can be found is returned. A
    manager which can only make one connection may then remove itself from its
    well-known bus name, causing a new connection manager to be activated when
    somebody attempts to make a new connection.
