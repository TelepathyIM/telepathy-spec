          If this property is TRUE then all the media streaming is done by a

          the media streaming at least some parts itself.
          <tp:rationale>
            A connection-manager might be intended for a specialized hardware
            device, which will take care of the audio streaming. (e.g.
            telepathy-yafono which uses GSM hardware which does the audio actual
            streaming for the call)

          <tp:rationale>
            When implementing a voip gateway one wants the outgoing leg of the
            gatewayed to have the same transport as the incoming leg. This

        <p>If set to true in a channel request that will create a new channel,
          the connection manager should immediately attempt to establish an
          audio stream to the remote contact, making it unnecessary for the

              namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Call.Draft">AddContent</tp:dbus-ref>.

        <p>If this property, or InitialVideo, is passed to EnsureChannel
          (as opposed to CreateChannel), the connection manager SHOULD ignore
          these properties when checking whether it can return an existing
          channel as suitable; these properties only become significant when
          the connection manager has decided to create a new channel.</p>

        <p>If true on a requested channel, this indicates that the audio
          stream has already been requested and the client does not need to
          call RequestStreams, although it MAY still do so.</p>

        <p>If true on an unrequested (incoming) channel, this indicates that
          the remote contact initially requested an audio stream; this does
          not imply that that audio stream is still active (as indicated by
          <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Call.Draft">Contents</tp:dbus-ref>).</p>

        <p>This property is immutable (cannot change), and therefore SHOULD

        <tp:rationale>

          a contact's capabilities with ChannelType = CAll
          in the fixed properties dictionary, and InitialAudio and/or
          InitialVideo in the allowed properties list. Clients wishing to
          discover whether a particular contact is likely to be able to

        <p>This property is the correct way to discover whether connection

            <p>For example, once an audio-only Google Talk call has started,

              User interfaces may use this pseudo-capability as a hint to
              display separate "Audio call" and "Video call" buttons, rather
              than a single "Call" button with the option to add and remove
              video once the call has started for contacts without this flag.

        <p>The client can implement streaming for streams whose <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Media.StreamHandler">NATTraversal</tp:dbus-ref>
          property is <code>wlm-2009</code>.</p>

      <tp:docstring>
        <p>The client supports media streaming with H264 (etc.).</p>

        <p>This handler capability token is a one of a family
          of similar tokens: for any other audio or video codec whose MIME
          type is audio/<em>subtype</em> or video/<em>subtype</em>, a handler
          capability token of this form may exist (the subtype MUST appear
          in lower case in this context). Clients MAY support more
          codecs than they explicitly advertise support for; clients SHOULD
          explicitly advertise support for their preferred codec(s), and
          for codecs like H264 that are, in practice, significant in codec
          negotiation.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>For instance, the XMPP capability used by the Google Video
            Chat web client to determine whether a client is compatible
            with it requires support for H264 video, so an XMPP
            connection manager that supports this version of Jingle should
            not advertise the Google Video Chat capability unless there
            is at least one installed client that declares that it supports
            <code>video/h264</code> on Call channels.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>For example, a client could advertise support for
          Speex, Theora and H264 by having three
          handler capability tokens,
          <code>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Call.Draft/audio/speex</code>,
          <code>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Call.Draft/video/theora</code> and
          <code>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.Call.Draft/video/h264</code>,
          in its <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Handler">Capabilities</tp:dbus-ref>
          property.</p>

        <p>Clients MAY have media signalling abilities without explicitly
          supporting any particular codec, and connection managers SHOULD
          support this usage.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>This is necessary to support gatewaying between two Telepathy
            connections, in which case the available codecs might not be
            known to the gatewaying process.</p>
