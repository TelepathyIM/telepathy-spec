  <interface name="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatcher.DRAFT"
    tp:causes-havoc="experimental">

    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>The channel dispatcher is responsible for responding to new
        channels and launching client processes to handle them. It also
        provides functionality for client processes to request that new
        channels are created.</p>

      <p>If a channel dispatcher is running, it is responsible for dispatching
        new channels on all
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Connection</tp:dbus-ref>s
        created by the
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">AccountManager</tp:dbus-ref>.
        Connections not created by the AccountManager are outside the scope
        of the channel dispatcher.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>Connections created by standalone Telepathy clients
          that do not intend to interact with the channel dispatcher
          should be ignored - otherwise, the channel dispatcher would try
          to launch handlers for channels that the standalone client
          was already handling internally.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>The current channel dispatcher is defined to be the process that
        owns the well-known bus name
        <code>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatcher</code> on
        the session bus. This process MUST export an object with this
        interface at the object path
        <code>/org/freedesktop/Telepathy/ChannelDispatcher</code>.</p>

      <p>Until a mechanism exists for making a reasonable automatic choice
        of ChannelDispatcher implementation, implementations SHOULD NOT
        register as an activatable service for the ChannelDispatcher's
        well-known bus name. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED that some component
        of the user's session will select and activate a particular
        implementation, and that other Telepathy-enabled programs
        can detect whether channel request/dispatch functionality is available
        by checking whether the ChannelDispatcher's well-known name is in use
        at runtime.</p>

      <p>There are three categories of client process defined by this
        specification:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Observer</dt>
        <dd><p>Observers monitor the creation of new channels. This
            functionality can be used for things like message logging.
            All observers are notified simultaneously.</p></dd>

        <dt>Approver</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Approvers notify the user that new channels have been created,
            and also select which channel handler will be used for the channel,
            either by asking the user or by choosing the most appropriate
            channel handler.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Handler</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Each new channel or set of channels is passed to exactly one
            handler as its final destination. A typical channel handler is a
            user interface process handling channels of a particular type.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

        A list of the extra interfaces provided by this channel dispatcher.

    <method name="StartRequest">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Start a channel request. This just creates a
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">ChannelRequest.DRAFT</tp:dbus-ref>
          object, which can be used to perform the actual request and track its
          success or failure.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>The request can take a long time - in the worst case, the
            channel dispatcher has to ask the account manager to put the
            account online, the account manager has to ask the operating
            system to obtain an Internet connection, and the operating
            system has to ask the user whether to activate an Internet
            connection using an on-demand mechanism like dialup.</p>

          <p>This means that using a single D-Bus method call and response
            to represent the whole request will tend to lead to that call
            timing out, which is not the behaviour we want.</p>
