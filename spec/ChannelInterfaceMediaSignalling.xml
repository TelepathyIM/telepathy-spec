    <tp:docstring>
      An interface for signalling a channel containing synchronised media
    sessions which can contain an arbitrary number of streams. The negotiation
    interface is based closely around the API of the Farsight library
    (http://farsight.sourceforge.net/). This in turn is based upon the IETF
    MMusic ICE drafts where connections are established by signalling potential
    connection candidates to the peer until a usable connection is found, and
    codecs are negotiated with an SDP-style offer and answer. However, the
    principles should be applicable to other media streaming methods and the
    API re-used without difficulty.
